# Shopping Cart 
My capstone React project

Utilises: 
- A React + Vue project 
- React Router for client-side routing 
- Component-based CSS Styling
- Lucide (icon component library) for icons
- FakeStore API for shopping items
- Material UI for the modal on Shop Page 

**Installed PropType for type debugging but React version too modern to use**

## Navigation Bar 
- Navigation between Home, Shop and Cart Pages 
- Clicking on the logo will return to home page
- Button next to cart page will show how many items are in cart
